 # Home Price Analysis and Prediction


## Overview

Welcome to the Home Price Analysis and Prediction project! This initiative aims to provide insights into the realm of real estate pricing trends and empower users with real-time predictions for home prices. Leveraging web scraping, data analysis, and 
Linear Regression, this project presents a comprehensive dashboard tailored for homeowners and potential buyers alike.

## Key Features

- **Dashboard Design**: Designed and constructed an interactive dashboard for predicting house prices. The dashboard employs a combination of web scraping and Linear Regression techniques.

- **Data Processing**: Carried out data cleaning and feature engineering on scraped records. This process ensures that the input data is accurate and well-prepared for the model.

- **Real-time Predictions**: Integrated the predictive model into the dashboard, enabling users to obtain real-time predictions for house prices based on provided attributes.

## Project Modules

- **Login**: Implemented a secure login module to protect user data and ensure only authorized access.

- **Services**: Provided various services within the dashboard, such as real-time price predictions, historical data analysis, and market trend insights.

- **Data Scraping**: Utilized web scraping to gather property information, including attributes and historical pricing, from real estate websites.

- **Data Cleaning**: Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure high-quality input for the predictive model.

- **Model Building**: Constructed a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on input features.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Flask**: Employed the Flask web framework to develop the user-friendly dashboard. Flask handles user interactions and serves real-time predictions.

- **Python for Prediction**: Utilized Python to build the Linear Regression model for predicting house prices based on input features.

- **Data Visualization Tools**: Leveraged data visualization tools to present insights and trends to users.

- **Text Editor/IDE**: Used a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to develop and maintain the project's website components.
